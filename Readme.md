# Koc University 443: Modern Cryptography Course project

In this project, I implemented **Diffie Hellman** key exchange protocol and **AES-CTR** encryption with **Python** and completed all the parts in project pdf.

### How to run:

- For starting the program run alice.py and bob.py in different terminals.

```
python alice.py
python bob.py
```

- For bonus part change file_name variable inside of bob.py and alice.py and run middle.py, alice.py and bob.py in different terminals

```
python middle.py
python alice.py
python bob.py
```
